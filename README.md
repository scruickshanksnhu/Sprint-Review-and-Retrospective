Final Questions


    -How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    -How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    -What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?


1) User stories were integral to ensuring that the needs of the end-users are consistently met. We learned a lot about software development on the business end, but it's important to remember how important the end-user experience is to most software. When the Product Owner communicates with these end-users, they will listen to these users explain how their needs aren't currently being met through the current software implementation. A good Product Owner will be able to pre-emptively ask clarifying questions so that developers and testers won't have to bug them for more information. Once the user stories and clear and understood, these User Stories are passed to developers and testers to implement these new features. By consistently taking in User Stories as feedback, your product will always be meeting the needs of your users.
2) Given all we learned I think it would be pretty silly for me to say that I would be looking to implement a Waterfall Method design for a software product. There are very specific instances where I might prefer that (for instance: if I knew for a fact there would be zero changes to the project for the duration of the lifecycle), but I think Agile is the way to go. Nothing in life is perfect, and certainly software development is no exception. Most of your projects are going to run into potentially significant changes during the development cycle. The way Agile manages to adapt these changes into smaller workgroups to prevent derailing the project is very intuitive. Not to mention I feel as if employees would be much happier given the increased levels of communications from all levels.
3) I think this answer will vary depending on the person, given the personal nature of the question. Ability and willingness to adapt is a very overlooked quality in a coworker. Given the ever-changing nature of coding and software development, having supportive coworkers who have a positive attitude in regards to project changes can will really help create a productive working atmosphere. Being someone who is stuck in their ways, or is always complaining will easily drag down morale of other coworkers. Equally I believe communication is necessary for being a good team member in software development. You can be the best coder in the world, but if you're not voicing ideas or concerns, you will be a sub-optimal team member.
